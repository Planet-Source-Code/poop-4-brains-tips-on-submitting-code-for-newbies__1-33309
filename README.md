### Source Code

```
1. DONT POST A QUESTION ON THE CODE FORUM!!
2. If you can, Make the program interesting like something original or something you think would catch the peoples eye.
3. (for votes) Make sure your code is indented, organized, and well commented.
4. Post a program at daytime, when the most ammount of people are on psc.
5. Make sure when you post it that people are not submitting code alot, or your submission will just slide off the ticker like it never existed.
6. Dont repost the same code over (people often get annoyed and just vote 1 or 2 stars)
I hope these help all of the newbies and if you have any more to add please add them in the 'comments' area.
